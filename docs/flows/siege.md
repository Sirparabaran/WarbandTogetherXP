# Flow: Siege (coop siege battle types + local siege)

**Status:** AUDITED
**Validated against commit:** `ce0e287` (steamid persistence,
runtime-verified 2026-08-23: the `@char_siege_center` stash lives in the
now sid-or-username-keyed char dict — persistence reference only. Prior
stamp `0b2500a`)

## Scope

How a coop player assaults a town/castle: the **dedicated siege** (battle
server runs the `coop_siege` mission) and the **local siege** (initiating
client fights an SP-style wall assault against AI, then reports the result).
Entry points: the coop center menu options `coop_center_assault` /
`coop_center_assault_local`. Exit state: garrison casualties applied (both
paths); on a win, both paths run the A7 victory applier plus the shared
capture-consequences script (`coop_siege_capture_consequences`).
The shared serialization/IPC/result tail is documented in
`battle-pipeline.md` — this dossier covers only the siege delta.

Module paths relative to `wse2work/Native-Coop-master/`; C paths relative to
repo root.

## State & events

- **Dict keys (siege delta):** `@map_type` ∈ {2 attack, 3 defend},
  `@map_scn` (walls), `@map_castle`, `@map_street`, `@map_party_id`
  (besieged center), `@p_castle_lord`/`@p_garrison` (enemy-party indices,
  0 for sieges, -1 for field), `@p_garrison_banner`.
- **Dict key:** `@char_siege_center` in the player's char dict — the
  locally-assaulted center; survives the client's disconnect AND the
  player_no/party reassignment on rejoin (preserved across
  `coop_save_character` rebuilds; helpers `coop_char_siege_center_set/_get`
  `module_coop_scripts.py:7558/:7573`; cleared by ev 16 and ev 17).
- **Slots:** `slot_center_coop_lock_player` — center encounter lock;
  `slot_center_siege_with_belfry` (`:261`) — picks belfry vs ladder variant;
  `slot_town_walls`/`slot_castle_exterior`/`slot_town_castle`/`slot_town_center`
  — scene sources.
- **Globals:** `$coop_round` (siege phase), `$coop_use_belfry`,
  `$belfry_positioned`, `$g_coop_asi_local_battle` (client),
  `$g_coop_center_party`/`$g_coop_center_type`/`$g_coop_center_scene`
  (client center-menu state).
- **Round types:** `coop_round_battle`=1, `stop_reinforcing_wall`=2,
  `town_street`=3, `stop_reinforcing_street`=4, `castle_hall`=5
  (`module_constants.py:2108–2112`); reserves: hall 20, street 80
  (`:2103–2104`).
- **Network events:** ch49 `request_siege`=26, `request_siege_local`=27,
  `local_fight_result`=17; ch125 `battle_available`=10,
  `start_siege_local`=42 (`header_common.py:216`, `:248–251`). Battle types:
  `module_constants.py:1995–1999`.

## Invariants

- The local-siege target lives in the **per-player char dict**
  (sid- or username-keyed since `ce0e287`; key-builder-owned naming)
  (`@char_siege_center`) because the client disconnects into its local
  mission and rejoins with a NEW player_no and slot-derived party — player
  and party ids identify nothing across that boundary (runtime-proven:
  player 3/party 6 at assault became player 5/party 8 at result). A field
  local fight (ev 16) clears any stale stash so an abandoned siege can't
  be misread as a capture.
- The wall scene must be sent from the server (`:8662–8666`) — center party
  slots are not synced to clients.
- Dedicated siege is single-round by design gate (`:5153–5157`); multi-round
  progression (walls -> street -> hall) exists only in listen mode.
- Local-siege party freeze (`disable_party` `:8656–8661`) must be undone by
  rejoin/`enable_party` (`multiplayer_campaign_player_joined:8164`) or exit
  save (`multiplayer_campaign_player_exit:8250`).
- For sieges the besieged center **is** the serialized enemy party 0;
  garrison casualty application therefore mutates the center party directly
  (`coop_apply_battle_results` via `@p_enemy0_partyid`).

## Audit: ours vs. native

| # | Behavior | Ours (anchor) | Native ground truth (evidence) | Verdict |
|---|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | Siege scene + variant: walls scene from `slot_town_walls`/`slot_castle_exterior`, belfry vs ladder from `slot_center_siege_with_belfry` | `module_coop_scripts.py:9086–9094`, `:8642–8651` | Identical sources to native: assault menus read `slot_town_walls`/`slot_castle_exterior` (`module_game_menus.py:5455–5457`, `:5815–5820`) and the belfry flag is the same slot native seeds at game start (`module_scripts.py:346–360`). Local-siege missions are literal copies of native `castle_attack_walls_{belfry,ladder}` with only a side-flag swap (`module_mission_templates.py:3222–3232`, `:3302–3309`). | OK |
| 2 | Belfry (dedicated `coop_siege`): pre-positioned at first entry point with `slot_scene_prop_belfry_platform_moved=1`; no push/rotate phase | `module_coop_mission_templates.py:5391–5423` (native trigger commented out at `:5391`), `:5469`; `module_coop_scripts.py:3187` | Native uses `common_siege_init_ai_and_belfry`/`_move_belfry`/`_rotate_belfry`/`_assign_men_to_belfry` (`module_mission_templates.py:981–1002`) — soldiers push the belfry to the wall. Coop deliberately replaces this (native triggers commented out, replacement block inline): belfries start at the wall, movement phase skipped. Intentional MP simplification. | OK |
| 3 | Defender composition: center party as enemy0 (garrison keys point there) plus every party attached to the center serialized as enemy1..N with per-party casualty round-trip via `@p_enemy{i}_partyid`; friendly AI parties within `coop_siege_join_radius` join as ally1..N (placeholder rule until a siege camp exists) | `coop_write_battle_data` roster sections + `script_coop_battle_dict_write_roster_party` | Native battles collect **attached parties** into the enemy side (`party_collect_attachments_to_party` -> `p_collective_enemy`, `module_game_menus.py:6045`, `:4247`). Coop now rosters them per-party (identity preserved for casualty apply-back — a collective party can't round-trip through the dict). Fixed `67239e5..d7955b7`, runtime-verified 2026-07-19 multi-client. Attacker-side filter tightened in A8 (`2845589`, verified 2026-07-25): lord-party whitelist + real-ally relation rule | OK |
| 4 | Multi-round siege (walls -> street -> hall) in listen mode; dedicated forced single-round | `module_coop_mission_templates.py:5150–5232`, `:5153–5157` | Dedicated single-round is documented in-code: "Dedicated siege v1 is single-round: the wall battle decides the siege" (`:5153–5155`). The multi-phase progression is inherited coop-mod (Banner Time) design, a deliberate extension over native's single-scene assault. | OK |
| 5 | Dedicated siege victory: capture fixed in `50f4ac1` (A5, runtime-verified 2026-07-10); A8 (`0b2500a`, runtime-verified 2026-07-25) moved it into the shared capture script and reordered it AFTER the A7 applier — political consequences now read the center's pre-transfer faction (latent A7-era ordering bug fixed) | `module_coop_scripts.py:11292–11325` | Native: successful assault transfers the center, handles lord capture/escape, prisoners, and post-siege menus — A7 applier + A8 capture script now cover the set | OK |
| 6 | Both capture paths run native `castle_taken` consequences via `coop_siege_capture_consequences`: `party_clear`, `slot_center_last_taken_by_troop` (initiator), prosperity −5, renown +5 to every participant, war damage 40/20 vs the old owner, full `give_center_to_faction`; local siege additionally gained the previously-missing A7 applier call (gold/battle renown/garrison prisoners/lord fate/political). Fixed A8 (`8b45f2a..db4a815`, merged `0b2500a`), runtime-verified 2026-07-25 (Bulugha Castle smoke: gold+renown+capture; prisoners confirmed once prisoner_management > 0 — native cap) | `module_coop_scripts.py:9786–9823`, `:9866–9889` | Native `castle_taken` menu (`module_game_menus.py:6569–6640`). Deliberately dropped as N/A in coop: `lift_siege` (no siege-camp state), besieger guard order (no besieger AI), keep-or-give-to-vassal menu (players are not vassals; centers go to `fac_player_faction`). Known cosmetic: local path prints both "has fallen" and "has captured" | OK |
| 7 | Battle types `siege_player_defend` (3), `village_*` (4/5), `bandit_lair` (6) are defined and handled by the dict loader, but nothing ever launches them | `module_constants.py:1996–1999`; only callers pass types 1/2 (`module_coop_scripts.py:8578`, `:8617`) | Confirmed by exhaustive grep: no `coop_write_battle_data` caller uses types 3–6. Group-C resolution (`1dc8fec`): kept as future-feature scaffolding, documented as "defined, not yet launched" here and in project-state — the divergence was the docs overstating them, now corrected | OK |

## Fix list

| # | From audit row | What diverges | Suggested owner/layer |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 5 | ~~Winning a dedicated siege does not capture the center~~ **Done**: capture in `50f4ac1` (A5); A8 (`0b2500a`) moved it into `coop_siege_capture_consequences`, ordered after the A7 applier. | `module_coop_scripts.py` BATTLE PIPELINE section |
| 2 | 6 | ~~Local-siege capture skips native consequences~~ **Done** (A8, `8b45f2a..db4a815`, merged `0b2500a`, runtime-verified 2026-07-25): shared capture script + A7 applier call on the local path. Residual (DEFERRED.md): local sieges never roster defender attachments; garrison stacks leak through the ev-17 `-2` path. | `module_coop_scripts.py` |
| 3 | 7 | ~~Dead battle types 3–6~~ **Done** (`1dc8fec`): kept as future-feature scaffolding, documented as "defined, not yet launched" (code untouched). Wire launch paths when the features are built. | `module_constants.py` + `module_coop_scripts.py` |
| 4 | 3 | ~~Attached defender parties excluded from the battle roster~~ **Done** (`67239e5..d7955b7`, runtime-verified 2026-07-19): attachments serialized as enemy1..N, proximity AI allies as ally1..N, casualties routed per party, markers on all rostered parties + startup sweep. Attacker-filter refinement **done** (A8 `2845589`, runtime-verified 2026-07-25): `spt_kingdom_hero_party` whitelist + same-faction-or-relation>0 rule; farmer/third-faction parties excluded, allied lords still join. | `module_coop_scripts.py` `coop_write_battle_data` |
