# Flow: XP Sync (char XP, stack upgrades, battle XP)

**Status:** AUDITED
**Validated against commit:** `ce0e287` (steamid persistence,
runtime-verified 2026-08-23: the rejoin-time full char push now fires
from `coop_player_hydrate` (ch49 identify ev 8 / 5 s fallback), not the
join handler, and char dicts are sid-keyed for Steam-identified players;
the packed protocol itself is unchanged. Prior stamp `9681486`: packed char
sync ch125 ev 36-40 replaces the per-value events this dossier used to
cite — XP now travels in `packed_misc` (ev 40) rather than the old
`char_sync_xp` (ev 21); runtime-verified via 2-client smoke, see
project-state. Prior stamp `632466c`, A7 loot-gold note closed — applier
merged `4ba5786`, runtime-verified 2026-07-24; A9 victory-gated XP pool
noted)

## Scope

How experience reaches player characters and their troops, and how the
authoritative value stays on the campaign server: (A) the char-XP push
(ch125 ev 40 `packed_misc`, part of the 5-message packed full sync), (B)
the per-stack upgradeable push (ch125 ev 22 — despite the
event name, it carries upgradeable counts, not XP), and (C) battle XP from
both battle modes (dedicated Phase 1/2 pipeline; local-fight ch49 ev 17).
Entry points: player rejoin, `request_char_sync`, battle results. Exit
state: client troop XP/level/points mirror the server; pending battle XP
consumed. Point-spending (raise events 4/5/6, `sync_pools` 12) is the char
screen's concern and only appears here where it gates XP state.

Module paths relative to `wse2work/Native-Coop-master/`.

## State & events

- **Events:** ch125 (net-optimizations packed sync, replaces the old
  per-value events 14/16-19/21/23/24, which are deleted and free):
  `char_sync_packed_core`=36 (attrs 6b×4 + level 6b, gold 31b raw, attr/skill/
  prof points 8/8/10b), `char_sync_packed_skills_a`=37 / `_skills_b`=38
  (7 skills per int, 4b each, ranges 0-20/21-41), `char_sync_packed_profs`=39
  (3 profs per int, 10b each), `char_sync_packed_misc`=40 (xp 31b raw,
  health 7b | renown 16b<<7), `char_sync_done`=20 (unchanged),
  `party_stack_num_upgradeable`=22 (unchanged, renamed from `party_stack_xp`
  in C5), `hero_sync_xp`=43 (companion troop id + xp, signed-delta apply,
  unconditional every sync batch). A full sync is 5 packed messages + ev 43
  per companion hero + ev 20 done (~7-10 messages vs the pre-packing 59+).
  ch49: `request_char_sync`=7 (screen-close re-sync: server flushes the
  deferred save then re-sends only the packed messages whose
  `coop_char_dirty_*` category bit is set — an unchanged char screen close
  sends hero-xp + done only, no packed message), `local_fight_result`=17
  (`header_common.py`).
- **Dict keys:** char dicts: `@char_battle_pending`, `@char_pending_party_xp`,
  `@char_pending_hero_xp`; battle dict: `@battle_xp_rand`,
  `@battle_num_players`, `@battle_player_{i}_name/strength`, `@hero_{i}_xp`.
- **Globals:** `$g_coop_set_xp_go/troop/value` (DLL pending XP set),
  `$g_coop_char_snap_ready` (client), `$g_coop_result_*` (client debrief),
  `$g_coop_pending_*` (client reconnect push).
- **Client snapshot slots:** `slot_coop_char_snap_*` on `trp_temp_troop` —
  the diff-poller baseline, written only by receive handlers.

## Invariants

- **Server XP is authoritative; the client applies signed deltas**
  (`:7210–7215`, ev 40 `packed_misc` arm) — this is what cancels the client
  engine's local kill-XP inflation. Never push absolute XP by `troop_set_*`
  on the client.
- **Companion troop XP reaches the client ONLY via ev 43** (runtime-verified
  2026-07-10, `13ebcad`; still true after the net-optimizations packing):
  ev 40 (`packed_misc`) is player-troop-only, ev 22 carries
  upgradeable counts, and the C-layer snapshot has no troop XP — without
  ev 43 the sheet shows an unsynced local copy that inflates in local
  missions and resets on rejoin.
- **The diff-poller baseline comes from receive handlers, not the client
  troop** (`:6755–6760` and project-state lesson) — snapshot-diff is racy
  otherwise.
- `coop_apply_xp_shares` is the single XP application path for both battle
  modes; both shares are base-safe against a pending DLL `set_xp`
  (`:9540–9557`).
- `coop_copy_register_to_hero_xp` applies XP as a delta chunked by 29999 per
  `add_xp_to_troop` call (`:4948–4956`).
- One shared `@battle_xp_rand` roll per battle (`:4728–4735`) keeps
  multi-player relative shares deterministic.
- The dedicated Phase 1 pool is **victory-gated** since A9 (`632466c`):
  it is computed only when `@battle_result == 1` — losses and retreats
  pay no XP pool.
- Engine lessons (project-state): variable proficiency cost — client engine
  is cost authority; `troop_raise_proficiency` does not consume WP; AGI +5 WP
  bonus is native-UI-only.

## Audit: ours vs. native

| # | Behavior | Ours (anchor) | Native ground truth (evidence) | Verdict |
|---|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | Dedicated battle XP pool: `(level+10)^2/10` per enemy casualty, cap 40000, × shared rand 50–100 | `module_coop_scripts.py:9488–9516`, `:4734` | Matches native `party_give_xp_and_gold` basis and formula (`module_scripts.py:15341–15373`, called with `p_total_enemy_casualties` at `module_game_menus.py:4674`); minor deltas documented in `battle-pipeline.md` audit row 2 | OK |
| 2 | Local-fight XP: same pool formula over actual casualties, cap 40000, **× rand(50,100)/100 after the cap** (native parity). Fixed in `50f4ac1`, runtime-verified 2026-07-10 (victory screen `pool 603 x roll 66% = 397`, exact integer match). Loot gold is now paid by the A7 consequence applier (merged `4ba5786`, runtime-verified 2026-07-24) | `module_game_menus.py` debrief (roll after `val_min` cap) | Native applies × rand(50,100)/100 after the cap (`module_scripts.py:15369–15371`) and also pays loot gold via `party_give_xp_and_gold` | OK |
| 3 | Local-fight XP applied entirely as party share (`party_add_xp` distribution) | `module_coop_scripts.py:8956–8959`, `:9534–9547` | Native SP applies the whole pool via `party_add_xp` to the main party (`module_scripts.py:15373`) — same semantics | OK |
| 4 | One XP-credit path reaches heroes on the dedicated battle path: the campaign-side hero restore skips the `@hero_{i}_xp` re-apply (`$g_coop_skip_hero_xp_restore` set around the restore in `coop_apply_battle_results`, `:9430–9432` @ `fc1f204`), so the computed Phase 1/2 pool share is the sole credit — SP parity. Fixed in `50f4ac1`, runtime-verified 2026-07-10 (companion gained a normal SP-sized share once; not double, not zero) | `module_coop_scripts.py:5251`, `:9430–9432` (@ `fc1f204`) | RE-confirmed (`patches/Warband/findings.md` "Engine mission kill-XP paths", `patches/WSE2Dedicated/kb.h`): the WSE2 dedicated server writes hero `m_experience` per kill for game types 11/12 (writer `0x487A90`), with **no game-type gate** — same mechanism the client-side local-fight path explicitly undoes (`:6798–6809`). The dedicated path previously round-tripped it through `@hero_{i}_xp` AND added the pool share on top (heroes paid twice); the skip flag makes the pool share canonical. | OK |
| 5 | Event 22 renamed `party_stack_num_upgradeable` (constant + script `coop_send_party_upgradeable_to_client`) and project-state row corrected — the name now matches the payload. Fixed in `1dc8fec`, runtime smoke passed 2026-07-11 | `module_coop_scripts.py` sender/recv arm; `header_common.py` | Sender uses `party_stack_get_num_upgradeable`, receiver `party_stack_set_num_upgradeable` — misnaming was doc/constant drift only | OK |
| 6 | Level + points: level derived from XP by the client engine; point pools pushed server-authoritatively (packed into ev 36 `packed_core`, int3); AGI WP bonus intentionally absent outside native UI | `module_coop_scripts.py:6935–6968`, `:7108–7141` | Engine derives level from XP identically on both sides; the AGI/WP and proficiency-cost deviations are known, documented engine lessons (workbench project-state notes) | OK |

## Fix list

| # | From audit row | What diverges | Suggested owner/layer |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 2 | ~~Local debrief omits the native rand(50,100)/100 scaling~~ Fixed (`50f4ac1`) + runtime-verified 2026-07-10. ~~Loot gold unpaid~~ **Done** by the A7 consequence applier (merged `4ba5786`, runtime-verified 2026-07-24 — see `battle-pipeline.md` row 6). | `module_game_menus.py` debrief |
| 2 | 5 | ~~Event 22 misnamed/misdocumented~~ **Done** (`1dc8fec`, smoke 2026-07-11): renamed `party_stack_num_upgradeable` (constant + script + project-state row). | `header_common.py` + workbench project-state doc |
| 3 | 4 | ~~Hero XP double-credited on the dedicated battle path~~ Fixed (`50f4ac1`) + runtime-verified 2026-07-10 — `$g_coop_skip_hero_xp_restore` suppresses the `@hero_{i}_xp` re-apply; the pool share is the canonical (sole) hero credit. | `module_coop_scripts.py:5251`, `:9430–9432` |

## Open questions

- ~~Exact per-player hero attribution of the double-credit~~ Settled by the
  row-4 fix (`50f4ac1`): the `@hero_{i}_xp` restore is skipped, making the
  Phase 1/2 pool share the single canonical credit path.
