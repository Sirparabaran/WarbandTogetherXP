# Flow: Inventory Sync (equip pushes, bag sync, screen close-diff)

**Status:** AUDITED
**Validated against commit:** `ce0e287` (steamid persistence,
runtime-verified 2026-08-23: char-dict naming is sid-keyed for
Steam-identified players and the join-time pre-warm push now fires from
`coop_player_hydrate` (ch49 identify / 5 s fallback), not the join handler;
this flow's own events are unaffected. Prior stamp `9681486`: the join-time
char sync this dossier's sequence diagram references is now 5 packed
messages, ch125 ev 36-40, not the old per-value events 16-24 — see
`xp-sync.md` for the char-sync detail; this flow's own events (15/25/26,
ch49 13/14/15) are unaffected. Prior: `9558722`, B2 push-on-mutation + B3
receive-handler baseline runtime smoke passed 2026-07-25, incl. the
smoke-session trade-purchase fix `6c4db5c`; row 6 fix + join-push
ordering 2026-07-10, group-C rows 4/5 2026-07-11)

## Scope

How a player's equipment (slots 0–9) and bag (slots 10–105) stay in sync
between the campaign server's authoritative troop struct and the client's
native inventory screen, and how gear reaches the battle server. Entry
points: campaign join (pre-warm push), native inventory window open/close,
battle spawn. Exit state: server troop + the per-player char dict
(`coop_char_sid_<acctid>` / `coop_char_<name>`, see key-builders) reflect
client edits. The trade screen has its own synced flow (ch49 ev 20–22 /
ch125 ev 29–32) and is out of scope here.

## State & events

- **Events:** ch125: `equip_slot`=15, `inv_bag_slot`=25, `inv_sync_done`=26;
  ch49: `request_inv_sync`=13 (re-added deliberately by B3 `2f2f2bc` per
  the C7 note — client sends on screen open, server replies with the full
  push), `inv_change`=14, `inv_sync_back_done`=15 (`header_common.py`).
- **Client globals:** `$g_coop_inv_screen_open` (0 idle / 1 open / 2 close
  processed; set by `wse_window_opened`), `$g_coop_inv_sync_ready`,
  `$g_coop_inv_snap_ready` (baseline mirrored — close-diff may run; set by
  ev 26, cleared when the diff fires or a trade close suppresses it).
- **Snapshot slots** on `trp_temp_troop`: equip items 160–169, equip mods
  170–179, bag items 180–275, bag mods 276–371
  (`module_constants.py:1944–1947`).
- **Dict:** equipment + bag with imods persisted per player in the char
  dict (`coop_char_sid_<acctid>.wsedict` for Steam-identified players,
  `coop_char_<name>.wsedict` otherwise — naming owned by the
  `coop_char_store_dict_name[_raw]` key-builders since `ce0e287`) by
  `coop_save_character`.

## Invariants

- Slots 0–9 are equipment, 10–105 bag; the bag push sends a clear signal
  (slot −1) before non-empty slots to purge stale client state without
  overflowing the send buffer (`:9654–9660`).
- Every `inv_sync_back_done` triggers a char-dict save — client edits are
  never left memory-only on the server (`:8770–8771`).
- Simple triggers pause during native windows, so `open==1` observed by the
  poller means "the screen just closed" (`module_simple_triggers.py:4541`).
- Item modifiers travel with every hop: ev 14/15/25 payloads and the char
  dict all carry imod.
- **Join push order: char sync before inventory.** The engine bounds
  `troop_set_inventory_slot` by `getNumInventorySlots()+10` — skill-derived
  (`30 + 6*IM` for hero troops), silent no-op out of range
  (`patches/Warband_WSE2/findings.md` "troop inventory slot bounds"). If bag
  slots arrive before the skill push raises the client troop's IM, the
  IM-bonus slots (e.g. 40–45 at IM 1) are dropped client-side — items
  "disappear on rejoin" while remaining in the server dict. Fixed by
  reordering `multiplayer_campaign_player_joined` pushes (char sync →
  equipment → inventory), mirroring `coop_load_character`'s skills-before-bag
  order; runtime-verified 2026-07-10.

## Audit: ours vs. native

| # | Behavior | Ours (anchor) | Native ground truth (evidence) | Verdict |
|---|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | Server-side inventory mutations (quest rewards, script grants) are pushed to the client only on join/rejoin — there is no push-on-mutation path | pushes exist only at `:8221–8222` (join) | The mod's own documented authority model ("clients receive pushes") implies server mutations should reach a live client; in native SP the question doesn't arise (single process). | OK (fixed B2 `87f4c82`: `coop_push_player_inventory` = single push-on-mutation contract, unified join/creation/INV-GUARD call sites; trade purchases applied server-side + pushed at trade_done `6c4db5c`; runtime smoke 2026-07-25) |
| 2 | Close-diff baseline is an **open-time snapshot of the client troop**, ungated | was `module_scripts.py` `wse_window_opened` snapshot loops, ungated poller diff | The char-sync flow implements the documented lesson ("baseline must come from receive handlers, not client troop") with a `snap_ready` gate; the inventory flow predated/skipped it. | OK (fixed B3 `75e9a57`: open sends ev 13, recv arms 15/25 mirror the baseline into the snap slots, ev 26 sets `$g_coop_inv_snap_ready`, poller diff gated char-sync-style; runtime smoke 2026-07-25) |
| 3 | Battle equip: gear rebuilt from campaign state on spawn; consumables not decremented in campaign inventory after battle | `module_coop_scripts.py:3025–3044`, `:3002–3024` | Native refills ammo/consumables after battles (campaign inventory is not charge-tracked) — rebuilding from campaign state yields the same net behavior | OK |
| 4 | Orphaned raw-slot 0–19 mirror deleted from the ev-15 recv arm (`1dc8fec`); the troop-struct writes that feed the native inventory screen remain. Smoke passed 2026-07-11 | ev-15 recv arm, `module_coop_scripts.py` | The actual diff baseline lives at slots 160–179 (`module_constants.py:1944–1945`), written by `wse_window_opened`/presentation — nothing read the raw-slot mirror | OK |
| 5 | ch49 ev 13 `request_inv_sync` constant + handler deleted (`1dc8fec`) — no sender existed; inventory is pre-warmed on join. Project-state row corrected (ID 13 marked free). Smoke passed 2026-07-11 | `header_common.py` (ID 13 free note) | If B2 (push-on-mutation) ever needs a client re-request, add one deliberately in that design | OK |
| 6 | Server applies `inv_change` verbatim — any item/imod a client names lands in the server troop and is persisted | `module_coop_scripts.py:8762–8768` | Violates the mod's server-authoritative design statement; a buggy or malicious client can mint arbitrary items (contrast: battle drops are slot-guarded server-side, `coop_generate_item_drop:9704–9706` "we hold the item in a slot, server-side, to prevent funny business") | OK (fixed `50f4ac1`: `coop_inv_sync_back_validate_and_save` count-validates each batch against the pre-edit dict baseline, commits or reverts whole batch; runtime-verified 2026-07-10 — legit edits stick, no false `[INV GUARD]` rejects) |

| 5 | 6 | ~~Validate `inv_change` server-side~~ **Done** (`50f4ac1`, runtime-verified 2026-07-10): batch count-validation against the pre-edit dict baseline in `coop_inv_sync_back_validate_and_save`, whole-batch revert + re-push on violation. | `module_coop_scripts.py` ev-14/15 arms |

## Open questions

None — all audit rows resolved module-side (native screen internals were
already covered by `docs/archive/RE_NATIVE_SCREENS.md`; no new engine RE required).

- Trade flow (ch49 20–22 / ch125 29–32): separate concern, no dossier yet.
  Interaction since `6c4db5c`: the server applies bought/sold items itself
  (`coop_ev_cli_trade_change` inverse) and `trade_done` ends with the full
  inventory push; a trade close suppresses the client's local inventory
  diff (trade-close poller block runs before the inventory-close block).
