# Install Guide

How to get playing, from a clean Warband install. Building from source is
a different document (`docs/BUILD.md`) — this one covers the
[release zip](https://github.com/Night1099/WarbandTogether/releases).

**You need:** Mount & Blade: Warband (Steam, v1.174), Windows 10 or
later, and the release zip. The zip contains everything else — do **not**
install WSE2 yourself.

One person **hosts** (runs the servers in the background); everyone,
host included, also plays on a normal game client. Hosting and playing on
the same PC is fine.

---

## Step 1 — Install the mod

1. Install Warband from Steam, launch it once, and quit.
2. Steam → right-click Warband → Manage → **Browse local files**.
3. Extract the release zip **directly into the Warband folder next to the game exe**.

Everyone does Step 1.

> Joining over Steam? That rename is the **only** `coop.ini` step you'll
> ever do — you never edit the file unless the host set a password
> (Step 4) or you're on LAN (Step 2B).

---

## Step 2 — Pick how you'll connect

| | Use this if | Router setup? |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Steam** *(recommended)* | Playing with friends over the internet | **None** |
| **B. LAN / direct IP** | Same house/network, or you already run a VPN like Hamachi or Tailscale

Do **A** or **B**, not both. Then continue to Step 3.

### A. Steam

**Host ONLY** — open `coop.ini.example` and reanme to `coop.ini` , then in the `[Steam]` section, uncomment this
line (delete the leading `;`):

```ini
SteamHost=1
```

That's it. While your game is running, your Steam friends will see a
**Join Game** button next to your name, and you can right-click a friend
→ **Invite to Game**.

> ⚠️ By default **anyone** who can click that button can connect. Set a
> password (Step 4) unless you're fine with that.

**Players** — change nothing in `coop.ini`. You'll join by clicking your
friend's Join Game button (or accepting their invite) in Step 5.

### B. LAN / direct IP (**Skip if using Steam**)

**Host** — ask Windows for your IP (`ipconfig` in a Command Prompt; use
the `IPv4 Address` line, e.g. `192.168.1.20`) and give it to your
friends. Leave your own `coop.ini` alone.

**Players** — open `coop.ini` and set the host's IP:

```ini
HostIP=192.168.1.20
```

host will have to open a firewall rule as well (admin powershell)
```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Warband Coop" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=7240-7267 profile=any
```

*(Playing over the internet without Steam? The host must forward UDP
ports **7240–7247** on their router. Option A avoids this entirely.)*

---

## Step 3 — Host: start the servers

From the game folder, run:

```
coop_launch_all.bat
```

This starts the campaign server, 2 battle servers, and your game client.
Want more simultaneous battles? `coop_launch_all.bat 4` (4 is the max).
Leave the black console windows open while you play.

---

## Step 4 — Optional: set a password

**Host** — in `coop.ini`, under `[Coop]`:

```ini
Password=mypassword
```

Max 47 characters. Restart the servers after changing it.

**Players** — put the same line in **your own** `coop.ini`
(`Password=mypassword`). With it there, invite auto-join sends the
password for you, and battle-server hops authenticate automatically.
Without it, accepting an invite only lands you in the multiplayer
browser — you can still type the password into the browser's password
box to join, but battles will reject you partway through the session.

---

## Step 5 — Join and play

Joiners Launch **`mb_warband_wse2.exe`** — *not* `mb_warband.exe` — and pick the
**NativeCoop** module.

**If you're using Steam (A):**

1. Make sure Steam is running **before** you start the game.
2. The Hosts game must be running too.
3. Click **Join Game** on their Steam friends list entry — or accept an
   invite they sent you (right-click → **Invite to Game**).
4. That's it. Within ~5–10 seconds the game navigates itself into the
   multiplayer browser and **joins automatically** — no clicks needed.
   (If you're mid-battle in singleplayer it waits until you leave the
   mission. On a passworded server without `Password=` in your
   `coop.ini`, it only opens the browser — join the **COOP Direct** row
   yourself and type the password.)

Invites work in every direction: you can Join Game on the host *or on
any friend already playing*, and both the host and joiners can
right-click a friend → Invite to Game. (One Steam quirk: two people
already in the same session lose the Join/Invite entries toward *each
other* — they still show toward everyone else.)

**If you're using LAN / direct IP (B):**

Multiplayer → Join a game. The server shows up automatically after lan scan — join it.

**Then, everyone:** first time in, you'll make a character. After that
your character, gear, gold and XP are saved on the host's server and
survive disconnects.

**Playing:**
- You all share one campaign map.
- Start a battle and you're taken to it automatically. Anyone else can
  press **B** on the map to see open battles and jump in.
- You get one life per battle. Casualties and XP land on your party when
  you return to the map.
- Yes the battles kcik you back to menu at end of play this will be more seamless in future but results are applied on rejoin
- Character, inventory, party and trade screens all work — changes save
  when you close the screen.

## Troubleshooting

**My character reset after updating.** Characters made before this
version were saved under your Windows/Steam profile name. Steam players
now get a character tied to their actual Steam account instead, so the
first time you join after updating, the game makes you a fresh
character — your old one isn't deleted, it's just no longer the one
that loads for you.

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Clicking Join Game / accepting an invite does nothing** | Your game and Steam must both already be running (the invite can't launch the game). With WSE2 its possible to be running game without steam in background so make sure its on. If you're already in a server, leave it first and click again. If you're in a singleplayer battle, the auto-join waits until you leave the mission. `warband_coop.log` in the game folder says exactly what happened |
| **No server in the list** | *Steam:* wait 10 s and press Search. *LAN:* wrong `HostIP`, or the host skipped the firewall step |
| **"Unable to connect"** | A firewall **block** rule on the host — see below. Also check the host's server consoles are actually open |
| **Battles kick you to the menu** | Your `HostIP` is still `127.0.0.1` (Step 2B) |
| **Battles never start** | Host has no battle server running — use `coop_launch_all.bat` |
| **Password rejected / invite won't auto-join a passworded server** | Make sure the same `Password=` line is in your own `coop.ini`; joining manually, retype it in the browser's password box |
| **Crash on launch** | You ran `mb_warband.exe`, or Steam updated Warband over the modded engine — re-extract the zip |
| **"Invalid Quick String ID"** | Delete `Modules\NativeCoop` and re-extract the zip |
| **B key does nothing** | No battle is open right now |

**Clearing a firewall block rule (host).** In PowerShell as
administrator:

```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -Direction Inbound -Action Block -Enabled True | ForEach-Object {
  $ports = ($_ | Get-NetFirewallPortFilter).LocalPort -join ','
  $prog  = ($_ | Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter).Program
  if ($ports -match '72[46]' -or $prog -match 'warband') { $_.DisplayName }
}
```

Then for each name it prints:

```powershell
Disable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "<name>"
```

## A note on `coop.ini`

Only three things in that file are meant for you: `HostIP`, `Password`,
and the `[Steam]` section — and if you're a player joining over Steam
on an unpassworded server, you never touch any of them. **Leave
`[NetTuning]` alone** — deleting it makes the connection worse.

Still stuck? Open an issue with your setup (LAN or Steam, how many
players) and the host's `warband_coop_host.log` from the game folder.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
