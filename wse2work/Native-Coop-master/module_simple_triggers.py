#
#  Each simple trigger contains the following fields:
# 1) Check interval: How frequently this trigger will be checked
# 2) Operation block: This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference.

  # Private siege wars need a small server-side AI bridge because the
  # campaign uses one shared fac_player_faction for all co-op players.  Only
  # nearby hostile lords are given a direct pursuit order: issuing it
  # map-wide made every lord converge permanently on one player.
  #
  # Fixed 2026-09-08 (was a deliberate placeholder, per the comment above --
  # unconditional pursuit regardless of relative strength): now compares
  # script_party_calculate_strength (same generic function
  # coop_check_lord_flee_ai uses) before deciding attack vs. avoid, so a
  # lord flees a stronger player instead of always closing in. This runs
  # every second and takes precedence in practice over
  # coop_check_lord_flee_ai's hourly kingdom-war check for any lord both
  # cover -- kept as two separate mechanisms (immediate personal siege
  # hostility vs. periodic formal kingdom war), now consistent with each
  # other instead of contradicting.

  # reads as set locally, which can still be unset if that confirmation
  # fires before the server's broadcast lands (hydration can take up to
  # ~5s for a non-identifying client, module_coop_mission_templates.py). By
  # the time that race-reopened instance appears, the one-shot flag has
